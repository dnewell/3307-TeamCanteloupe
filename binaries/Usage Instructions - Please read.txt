Hello!

Team Canteloupe is excited to share our first prototype with you!  Keep in mind, we still have a long way 
to go with our development of a user-friendly workflow for the application, so for now, a few quick notes 
might be helpful to get you up and running with our Stage 1 Demo:

1) Upon first loading the program, please click "Load Teaching *.csv" and browse to a CSV file
containing teaching data. Select the file, and then click on the "Open" button.

2) Select the date range that you wish to view with the 2 drop down menus, and then click the "Filter" button.
The collapsible/expandable lists are now populated with the data from your file, and you can browse the stats
at your leisure.

3) If you wish to view a graph of the data, click on the "Graph" button.

4) At any time, you may select a new date range, and view the updated summary and/or visualization for that new range.

Thanks, and we hope you enjoy this small sample of things yet to come!  

- Team Canteloupe
