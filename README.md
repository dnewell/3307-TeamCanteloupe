# **AcuitySTAR Dashboard** by Team Cantaloupe
#### Created for CS3307a - a course on OO Design and Analysis
### What is the project for?
The **AcuitySTAR Dashboard** program was by created by the members of Team Cantaloupe as part of a collaborative program between the [Computer Science Department at Western University](www.csd.uwo.ca) and the [Schulich School of Medicine](http://www.schulich.uwo.ca/).

The purpose of this collaboration was to address an increasing interest in the large amount of  aggregate data generated by the STAR (Staff Tracking & Activity Reporting) web application. STAR is a tool used to capture and report on clinical faculty career activities.

### So, what does it do? Why a dashboard?


Before **AcuitySTAR Dashboard**, analysis of this large dataset (STAR has over 1,500 users across 14 clinical departments) was only possible manually, and its utility was entirely dependant on an individual user's motivation and expertise.

AcuitySTAR Dashboard **automates this analysis**, and provides a consistent solution which functions across each of the 14 departments in Schulich.  This responsive program (written in **C++**, and using **Qt 5.5**), can quickly process CSV files containing **20,000+ rows**, and produce a variety of printable, customisable graphs as well as navigable text summaries.  It has an interactive error checking and correction tool, and also contains a number of automated data validation steps.
